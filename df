    Commit name:  Before redoing databases!!
    
    1. Added more json endings and exported all of my data to data folder in json
    format.
    2. new python script getjasonback.py in order to rebuild my database.
    
    What I will do now:
    1. Add a user table, to add data from logged in users.
    2. Add permision code so not all pages will be visible to all users, and
    some functions will be disabled for some users too.
    3.  Eventually change the base.html file to show the logged in user.

    Commiting all of the files theis time.  added the html files etc...
    
    State:  Everything compiles, webpage runs well:
    What is not working:
    1. Facebook login and Google Login working, but need to work on adding the
    users to db, and adding permisions to functions.
    login page does not redirect to main page either.
    2. Ranking system is working topTenlists.
    3. On unranked section of toptenlist, we are showing an icon that shouldnt
    be shown, and the hover is not working either on these pics.
    4.  Added base.html template, and started remaking pages so they inherit
    from this page. about 3 pages have been remade with this, createitem,
    toptenlist, edititem, deleteitem.
    Need to remake all other pages so they inherit from this page too.
    4. Navbar too thick, make leaner
    5. Login portrait needs to be worked on.
